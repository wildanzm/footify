# Footify - Diabetic Foot Screening Application

Footify is a web-based application designed to assist healthcare professionals in performing a quick, accurate, and documented screening for diabetic feet. It is based on the standardized **Inlow‚Äôs 60-Second Diabetic Foot Screen** to automatically classify risk levels and provide care recommendations.

## About The Project

The main goal of Footify is to streamline the diabetic foot screening process. By digitizing the Inlow's 60-second method, the application guides healthcare providers through a systematic assessment, minimizing guesswork and ensuring all critical risk factors are evaluated. The system automatically calculates a risk score based on the inputs and provides a clear risk classification, helping to standardize patient care.

This project was built as a modern, single-page-like experience, ensuring a fast and responsive user interface for efficient data entry.

## Key Features ‚ú®

  * **Multi-Step Screening Form:** A guided, step-by-step wizard that walks the user through all stages of the Inlow‚Äôs 60-second diabetic foot screen, from patient identity to detailed physical examination.
  * **Automated Risk Classification:** The application automatically processes the screening data to classify the patient's risk level into categories such as Very Low Risk, Low Risk, Moderate Risk, High Risk, and Urgent.
  * **Dynamic Recommendations:** Based on the final risk classification, the system suggests appropriate care actions and follow-up schedules.
  * **Clean & Responsive UI:** The user interface is designed to be clean, minimalist, and fully responsive, working seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
